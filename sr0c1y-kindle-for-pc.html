Recently, I bought this Japanese dictionary (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FD9549A/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title), Kindle for PC is also listed in "Available on these devices", but I can't get It work. I downloaded It on my Kindle PC but It isn't listed in dictionary list. I need it to translate inflections since the default progressive Japanese - English can't do that. Can anyone I posted this issue over at r/techsupport but have received no replies yet. https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/974zd0/help\_with\_kindle\_for\_pc\_issue\_on\_win\_10\_x64/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/974zd0/help_with_kindle_for_pc_issue_on_win_10_x64/) Maybe I'll find some answers or even the solution here. Would appreciate it very much if someone can help me out. Thanks in advance. I recently started using Kindle for PC again (on my tablet) and noticed that there is now a gray bar on the left-side of the screen that persists at all times (even in full screen mode.) Is there a way to disable this bar, or someone we could make a request to have a setting to remove this bar? (Or, at the least, set it to a color that matches the reading text.it's so distracting!) Thanks. Does anyone know if there is a limit in the number of free ebooks Kindle for pc will allow you? I have 5 in there, added another just now and it wants me to start paying a monthly sub to use it. I thought free meant I have a new laptop - an HP that runs on Windows 10 x64. Got it last July 9 only. My problem is with the Kindle for PC app. I have emailed and chatted with Amazon CS but to date, my issue has never been resolved and I'm getting frustrated. I used to have a Kindle Fire but it got burned out early this year. Anyway, here's the problem: I installed latest for Kindle for PC app. It always always runs perfectly the first time after install. However, when I exit and then come back to it later My Kindle for PC updated on 05/14 and ever since the Japanese dictionary isn't working and I am not sure what to do. :\-/ I have attached an image of what I see when i try to look up a word. The Japanese to English dictionary works but translation dictionaries lack real content and i rely on the Japanese \- Japanese dictionary for better understanding of words. I was using my Kindle for PC up until the update with no issues and I've only started having the issue immediately after it updated. I'm trying to add a mobi file to my devices, and thus far, I can only open it in Kindle for PC. I can't manage it through amazon's website - it's simply not listed - which is why I don't think it's syncing to my kindle app on my Pixel. It's like the PC app see's it, but amazon doesn't identify it. or something. I'm not sure how to troubleshoot. As mentioned in the title, usually when I summarize chapters for uni I split the screen and have the source material on the left and my onenote on the right to take notes while reading. With kindle, this doesn't seem to be possible. Even though I have the font size, alignment and page width set to the minimum, kindle still takes up ca 80amp#37; of the screen, making it impossible to have two windows open next to each other. Does anybody have a solution for this? Greetings. 
Hi everyone, I bought a Russian dictionary on Amazon to use it as a built-in dictionary on Kindle for PC, but I can't see it on the dictionary list. There are more than 10 more dictionaries but the one I bought is not there. Is it not possible to buy a dictionary and use it on Kindle for PC? I de-registered and re-registered the device. didn't work. btw: I can see the dictionary on my library. However, I can't use it as a dictionary like the built-in oxford English dictionary. edit: I contact. I only use Kindle when no alternative is available, it's just so frustrating to wait a whole second for a page to turn no matter how fast I turn my scroll wheel. Why is that limit there? It's seems inferior to reading a PDF in every single. There's a strange problem with Kindle PC on my laptop (Windows 8 64 bit). When I double-click a word, the default dictionary starts downloading, but then after completion, it starts from 0. The process is never-ending. The issue doesn't depend on the dictionary that I choose for downloading or my Internet connection. Has anyone encountered this problem. Does Kindle for PC include the Audible narration, or is that only included with Kindle for Android/iPhone. </p>

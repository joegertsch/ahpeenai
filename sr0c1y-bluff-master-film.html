                            <p> Saira Banu was 16 years old in 1960, the year she made her debut to Hindi films. She said in a programme that she had basic talent and little dancing experience. Her peers all were classically trained, which was why she wasn't put in the top league. Saira started taking Kathak and Bharata Natyam lessons with success, and trained herself professionally. Soon she became a dancer, and her films flaunted more of her dance. Banu made her acting debut opposite Shammi Kapoor in the 1961 film Jungle. Bit of a pointless post but something I was curious about.

Note (I was going to write a big essay, but I decided to break it up as it's taking longer and I have less free time these days) Alright. So you want a powerful, competent Naruto. But you don't want to shove magical eyeballs into his head, or spend however many chapters trying to explain and rationalize just how Naruto happens to naturally have said magic eyeballs. You don't want to give him overpowered elemental bloodlines that either only one person ever naturally had, or just can't think. My first attempt at cosmic horror. It was written in a rush so it may not be my best work, but I'm trying to get back into writing and figured this may be a good outlet. I have some other ideas I'm working on as well.

Constant cold and darkness just make me feel depressed. The constant cold and darkness framing the shit neighborhood I live in depress me even more.

The flight was unventful, mercifully. While having flown before, it‚Äôs still not Saul‚Äôs favorite activity. It beats the Hades out of the Gray Sisters‚Äô Taxi though, at least the plane knew that it was supposed to stay in the sky; he‚Äôs pretty sure that the ground is more a guideline for that Taxi.

It could be a particular visual detail, an aspect of the editing, or some little quirk of the soundtrack.

The Kessel Run features the same motif that John Williams used for the Asteroid Belt sequence in The Empire Strikes Back. Aurra Sing is referenced when Lando thanks Beckett for killing Sing by pushing. Dad got me started young. It was just Saturday nights at first, when he'd wait for Mom to be caught up in her shows, but over time, it became more frequent, until he was at my bedroom door at least two or three nights a week. I'd hear his footsteps coming down the hall and I would stop whatever I was doing and I would wait for him to appear and, when he did, he always asked the same question with that same smile. ‚ÄúHey, Sunny,‚Äù he'd say, ‚Äúwant to play some Dungeons and Dragons?‚Äù 
Preface because it's a bit lengthy: Our DM is new-ish, our party is new-ish, and the characters, plot and world are all pretty casual. No epic plot, no shocking drama, no lovable and compelling characters being endearing. The GM gave us a casual setting about as gritty as an air balloon, and she gleefully enabled our shenanigans. So we ran with it. My point is: if you're looking for serious stories, you won't find this satisfying. If you're the type to get a kick out of Stupid-but-Practical. It‚Äôs Queer Pride in the big city, so lots of LGBTQ events this week. Be safe, y‚Äôall. Use condoms. Happening this week: Rotten Fest @ The Bark! 4/20-4/21. ‚ÄúIf you're interested in underground music, weirdo music, freak music, music that hasn't been co-opted into the faux indie trash-fire that is the spotify-worshipping, brand obsessed world/industry of independent music today, you are cordially invited to join us in celebration of the weirdos, the freaks and the dropouts for out 4th annual. Hello, everyone! For this week's Warcraft lore thread I'll be covering everyone's favorite goblin tinker: Gazlowe! Originally planned to be introduced as a supporting character in the canceled Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans , Gazlowe ended up making his first canon appearance as a minor quest giver NPC in Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne  Since then he hasn't had too much of a major presence in Warcraft , his most notable contributions being in the novel The Shattering: Prelude. ## What this is: This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either: - newly posted in the past 7 days , or - ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow) and have at least a fighting chance of being funded. All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!) Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm I'm trying to keep this a regularly occurring thing and will edit/update it as needed but, be warned, it is a lot of work to generate this.

Please drop a comment about what you thought as you read this. With over 1,500 views and only 22 comments- I'm a little put off. I still check this thread for updates months later, I have enjoyed reading every comment Hi there. My name is Leeland and this is going to be quite a story. I will be hyper linking things here and there- so you may want to read through once before getting distracted. Folks, let me be honest with you guys. I am someone who when Trump first announced thought " oh dear God, the egomaniac from The Apprentice is running for president. I wonder if this is a publicity stunt? Frankly I think this is pretty awesome just because politicians have been so corrupt that some crazy Loose Cannon jumping in and screwing everything up might be the only way to get the system fixed. Fine you know what, fuck it. I'm supporting Trump for the lulz. And hopefully whatever clean. ## What this is: This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either: - newly posted in the past 7 days , or - ~~ ending in the next 7 days and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.~~ ^see ^footnotes All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask.
